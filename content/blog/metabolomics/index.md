subtitle: "Using untargeted metabolomics on plants, foods, cells, and mammals"
excerpt: "Metabolomics allows the comprehensive profiling of hundreds to thousands of small molecules present within a system.  By using this approach, we can understand how metabolic changes (in plants, cells, animals, or people) are affected by our research question, and generate new ideas we may not be able to a priori hypothesize."

Metabolomics allows the comprehensive profiling of hundreds to thousands of small molecules present within a system.  By using this approach, we can understand how metabolic changes (in plants, cells, animals, or people) are affected by our research question, and generate new ideas we may not be able to a priori hypothesize.

Here is some work we've published on the topic:
